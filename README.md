# Optimizing Vaccine Distribution and Epidemic Parameter Estimationg

This scientific initiation project, conducted at IFSP - Sert√£ozinho, focused on two key objectives: first, to determine the optimal distribution of vaccines across multiple populations; and second, to estimate the parameters of an epidemic model based on time series data of infected individuals.




## Mathematical Background

###  Epidemic Model
The epidemic model used was the classic SIR model where population is divided in 3 "clusters", susceptible (S), infectious (I) and removed/recovered (R). S, I and R are a fraction of the total population (N) such that $S + I + R = N$
